# Overview

{Through this game project, I was able to learn a lot, however, when I was looking for sources I came to conclusion that I want to study more of server and cloud. First I will be
getting AWS amzon certificate, and wil be learning Azure. Then in the future, I would like to work at Amazon cloud provider or developer.}

{I use object-oriented programming language building games using lanauge c#. It's a car game that I used several different classes and abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and so on.}

{In this game, the player operates a police car by utilizing the left and right arrow keys. The game begins after the player presses enter. Cars will drive down the road in the opposite direction as the player's vehicle during gameplay. If the player's car collides with or hits another car, they will lose one life. The game ends when the player loses all three of their lives.}

# Future Work

Better Error Handling, I took so many times to figure out the errors and code is a bit messy.
Better design, so that I want to make it cool and better sound.
Better Memory Management because Object-oriented programming can be resource-intensive, I want to improvem in how memory is managed in these systems.
